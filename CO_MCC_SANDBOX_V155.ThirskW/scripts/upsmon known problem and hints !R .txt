KNOWN PROBLEMS:
1) Pilots are very stupid if they have to land, sometimes they crash the helicopter (trees).
2) Sometimes a vehicle stops and wait for something (driver switches off the engine)? In the end (~2min) stuck control makes it move but I do not know if the problem is UPSMON or Arma.
Difficult to reproduce cause it happens at random times and very rarely. Expecialy when reinforcement AI use combat vehicle. Possible explanation: targetpos in the forest, AI lost the way, no radio contact etc :)

HINTS & TIPS :


-------------------
0) To get rid of the debug information set (in Init_UPSMON.sqf) KRON_UPS_Debug = 0;



-------------------
1) note for MissionMakers : UPSMON patrol vehicles after some time use up all fuel and stop. 
Use a script to refuel the vehicles.



------------------
2)	- Hide area markers before briefing. -
	
	create Game Logic Object
	put in initialization field:
	
		nul = call compile preprocessFile "scripts\UPSMON\!R\markerAlpha.sqf";

	(all markers area must be named area0, area1...area13)
	

------------------	
3) If you use civilians, always set their skill to 0 (save CPU).	




------------------
4) in init.sqf do not use:

		if (isServer) then
		{
			//Init UPSMON scritp
			call compile preprocessFileLineNumbers "scripts\Init_UPSMON.sqf";    
		};

use:

		//Init UPSMON scritp
		call compile preprocessFileLineNumbers "scripts\Init_UPSMON.sqf";    

as Init_UPSMON.sqf has got part of the code which should be run on all clients.


----------------
5) If you fight on the small area think about lowering the "KRON_UPS_sharedist".
example: If the fight area is a town (600x600) and "KRON_UPS_sharedist = 700;", in the moment you are spotted at the edge of the town
all AI units in the 700m from you gets info about your position, and if they are not busy you can expect attack of all units.

Hello UPSMON users,

I'm currently run the project but I'm not very good at creating new function to the UPSMON as I'm not good script writer.
I feel much better as a person who can adjust existing code to work with UPSMON well.
95% of the functions in UPSMON were there (created by Kronzky or Monsada). 
I just make some of them work more smooth, and fixed some bugs. 
The aim is reliability, performance and make all end user friendly.

So if you found a bug or had improved part of the code... let me know.
Any new code that could make UPSMON runs better or add new functions is very welcome. :)
